text2 = The red/black ink, first thought to be some form of berry or natural dye ink, was later found to be human blood from multiple subjects.
text3 = Multiple test subjects have been allowed access to the score. In every case, the subjects mutilated themselves in order to use their own blood to finish the piece, resulting in subsequent symptoms of psychosis and massive trauma.

[SCP-035]
image1 = 035.jpg
text1 = SCP-035 appears to be a white porcelain comedy mask, although, at times, it will change to tragedy.
text2 = When SCP-035 is placed on the face of an individual, an alternate brain wave pattern from SCP-035 overlaps that of the original host, effectively snuffing it out and causing brain death to the subject. Subject then claims to be the consciousness contained within SCP-035.
text3 = Psychological analysis has discovered SCP-035 to possess a highly manipulative nature, capable of forcing sudden and profound changes to interviewer's psychological state. SCP-035 has proven to be highly sadistic, prompting some to commit suicide with linguistic persuasion alone.

[SCP-049]
image1 = 049.jpg

[SCP-294]
image1 = 294.jpg
text1 = Item SCP-294 appears to be a standard coffee vending machine, the only noticeable difference being an entry touchpad with buttons corresponding to an English QWERTY keyboard.
text2 = Upon entering the name of any liquid using the touchpad, a standard 12-ounce paper drinking cup is placed and the liquid indicated is poured.
text3 = Ninety-seven initial test runs were performed (including requests for water, coffee, beer, and soda, non-consumable liquids such as sulfuric acid, wiper fluid, and motor oil, as well as substances that do not usually exist in liquid state, such as nitrogen, iron and glass) and each one returned a success.

text2 = SCP-427 was created after placing a pill of SCP-500 in the Input booth of SCP-914 and using the Fine setting. It displays no unusual activity when closed. When SCP-427 is opened and exposed to biological tissue, it rapidly regenerates cellular damage and somehow is able to purge invading compounds or infections.
text3 = However, long-term exposure produces a significant health hazard. As the locket heals damage, it optimizes the body's natural systems. Class-D personnel exposed to the device for over an hour total began mutating into a shapeless mass of tissue.
text4 = The "Flesh Beasts" created by SCP-427 are incredibly aggressive, attacking any and all personnel on sight with lethal results. They are highly resistant to most known weaponry.

[SCP-457]
image1 = 457.jpg
text1 = For all points and purposes, SCP-457 appears to be a sentient being composed of flame. SCP-457's actual composition is unknown, and has proven to be invisible and undetectable by any known means, but is shaped out by the flames it produces, often assuming a human-like form if given sufficient fuel to assume that size.
text2 = SCP-457's most rudimentary form appears to be that of a single flame, comparable in size to that of a matchstick. In this form, SCP-457 possesses only the simplest of directives and shows no signs of being unusual compared to any other flame beyond a penchant for suddenly flickering to burn human hands, and the ability to 'jump' to more flammable materials or other flames, which it then assimilates into its total form.
text3 = As SCP-457 grows larger, it is able to assume more complex shapes, and its intelligence grows with size and fuel sources. SCP-457's method of intelligence is unknown, but upon reaching an approximately human size, SCP-457 almost always assumes a human-like form surrounded by and composed of flames.

[SCP-500]
image1 = 500.jpg
text1 = SCP-500 is a small plastic can which at the time of writing contains forty-seven (47) red pills.

text3 = Wearers of SCP-714 show increased tolerance to various chemicals and abnormally high resilience to memetic and mental influences.

[SCP-860]
image1 = 860.jpg
text1 = SCP-860 is a dark blue key of unremarkable shape.
text2 = At seemingly random intervals of time, a series of numbers will appear on the key's blade. These were later found to be UTM coordinates.
text3 = SCP-860 can fit and unlock any traditional door lock that requires a key located in the area of the given coordinates.

[SCP-1048]
image1 = 1048.jpg
text1=SCP-1048 is a small teddy bear, approximately 33 cm in height. Through testing, composition of the subject revealed no unusual qualities that make it discernible from a non-sapient teddy bear.
text2=Subject is capable of moving of its own accord, and can communicate through a small range of gestures. The subject regularly shows affection to individuals in ways found endearing by most people.
text3=It is hypothesized that the subject is able to construct crude replicas of itself using various materials, by a process that has yet to be observed directly by Foundation staff.
text4=The whereabouts of SCP-1048 are currently unknown.

[SCP-1048-A]
image1 = 1048a.jpg
text1 = On __/__/____, SCP-1048-A was discovered wandering Site 24. Subject resembles a teddy bear similar in size and shape to SCP-1048, but is made entirely out of human ears.
text2 = Upon confrontation, SCP-1048-A will emit a high pitched shriek inflicting intense pain in the eyes and ears of everyone in a 10 meter radius.
text3 = Immediately upon perceiving the shriek emitted by SCP-1048-A, affected subjects begin developing ear-like growths on their entire bodies, quickly leading to death by asphyxiation.
